# Smart-Ultrasonic-Water-Level-Monitoring-System
This project implements a smart water level monitoring system using an ultrasonic sensor. It accurately measures the water level in a tank and displays the information on an LCD screen. The system is powered by an Arduino microcontroller and is designed for easy installation and operation.The Ultrasonic Sensor emits sound waves towards the water surface and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back. By knowing the speed of sound in air, the Arduino calculates the distance to the water surface. Using the tank depth information, it then computes the water level and displays it on the LCD screen.
